//! Abstractions for asynchronous programming.
//!
//! This crate provides a number of core abstractions for writing asynchronous
//! code:
//!
//! - [Futures](crate::future::Future) are single eventual values produced by
//!   asychronous computations. Some programming languages (e.g. JavaScript)
//!   call this concept "promise".
//! - [Streams](crate::stream::Stream) represent a series of values
//!   produced asynchronously.
//! - [Sinks](crate::sink::Sink) provide support for asynchronous writing of
//!   data.
//! - [Executors](crate::executor) are responsible for running asynchronous
//!   tasks.
//!
//! The crate also contains abstractions for [asynchronous I/O](crate::io) and
//! [cross-task communication](crate::channel).
//!
//! Underlying all of this is the *task system*, which is a form of lightweight
//! threading. Large asynchronous computations are built up using futures,
//! streams and sinks, and then spawned as independent tasks that are run to
//! completion, but *do not block* the thread running them.

    //! Cross-task communication.
    //!
    //! Like threads, concurrent tasks sometimes need to communicate with each
    //! other. This module contains two basic abstractions for doing so:
    //!
    //! - [oneshot](crate::channel::oneshot), a way of sending a single value
    //!   from one task to another.
    //! - [mpsc](crate::channel::mpsc), a multi-producer, single-consumer
    //!   channel for sending values between tasks, analogous to the
    //!   similarly-named structure in the standard library.

pub mod executor {
    //! Task execution.
    //!
    //! All asynchronous computation occurs within an executor, which is
    //! capable of spawning futures as tasks. This module provides several
    //! built-in executors, as well as tools for building your own.
    //!
    //! # Using a thread pool (M:N task scheduling)
    //!
    //! Most of the time tasks should be executed on a [thread
    //! pool](crate::executor::ThreadPool). A small set of worker threads can
    //! handle a very large set of spawned tasks (which are much lighter weight
    //! than threads).
    //!
    //! The simplest way to use a thread pool is to
    //! [`run`](crate::executor::ThreadPool::run) an initial task on it, which
    //! can then spawn further tasks back onto the pool to complete its work:
    //!
    //! ```
    //! #![feature(pin, arbitrary_self_types, futures_api)]
    //! use futures::executor::ThreadPool;
    //! # use futures::future::{Future, lazy};
    //! # let my_app = lazy(|_| 42);
    //!
    //! // assuming `my_app: Future`
    //! ThreadPool::new().expect("Failed to create threadpool").run(my_app);
    //! ```
    //!
    //! The call to [`run`](crate::executor::ThreadPool::run) will block the
    //! current thread until the future defined by `my_app` completes, and will
    //! return the result of that future.
    //!
    //! # Spawning additional tasks
    //!
    //! Tasks can be spawned onto a spawner by calling its
    //! [`spawn_obj`](crate::task::Spawn::spawn_obj) method directly.
    //! In the case of `!Send` futures,
    //! [`spawn_local_obj`](crate::task::LocalSpawn::spawn_local_obj)
    //! can be used instead.
    //!
    //! # Single-threaded execution
    //!
    //! In addition to thread pools, it's possible to run a task (and the tasks
    //! it spawns) entirely within a single thread via the
    //! [`LocalPool`](crate::executor::LocalPool) executor. Aside from cutting
    //! down on synchronization costs, this executor also makes it possible to
    //! spawn non-`Send` tasks, via
    //! [`spawn_local_obj`](crate::executor::LocalSpawn::spawn_local_obj).
    //! The `LocalPool` is best suited for running I/O-bound tasks that do
    //! relatively little work between I/O operations.
    //!
    //! There is also a convenience function,
    //! [`block_on`](crate::executor::block_on), for simply running a future to
    //! completion on the current thread, while routing any spawned tasks
    //! to a global thread pool.
